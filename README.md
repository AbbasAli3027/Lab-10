## Design Choices

The design of this webpage follows a modern and clean aesthetic, with a focus on usability and responsiveness. The color scheme uses custom pink and purple shades to create a visually appealing look. Bootstrap components and utilities have been used extensively to ensure consistency and ease of development.

## Responsive Design

Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities have been used to create a responsive layout. The navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, and the grid system ensures that the services and portfolio sections adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was customizing the Bootstrap theme colors. This was achieved using custom CSS variables. 

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of Bootstrap to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing webpage. The customizations and additional styling enhance the overall look and feel of the page while maintaining responsiveness and usability.
